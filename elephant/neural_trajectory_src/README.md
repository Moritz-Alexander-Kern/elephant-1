# gpfa
Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA), based on Byron Yu's MATLAB implementation

The original MATLAB code is available at Byron Yu's website:
https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/software.shtml

The directory "gpfa_v0203" contains the original MATLAB code files (`***.m` files) and their file-to-file translations to Python (`***.py` files, with the same filenames as the original `***.m` files).
The directory "gpfa_elaphant" contains only the Python codes, which are (to be) adapted to ELEPHANT conventions.
